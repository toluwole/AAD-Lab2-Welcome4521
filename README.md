MENU USING LISTVIEW

INTRODUCTION
We already got familiar with the development environment of Android and implemented
our first simple applications on Android in the last lab. Today, we will extend the COMP 4521
application further, in the process learning about new features of the Android platform. We
will make use of the functions offered by Android to build applications with multiple
activities, and how we can launch another activity from the current activity. Then we will
learn how to create a menu in the application.

OBJECTIVES
